# battlescript
Battleship, but make it ~ binary ~

2020-02-09: 
  - Years ago as a freshman at MSU I attempted to build this battleship simulator. Needs tweaks. Or maybe a complete overhaul. To be determined...

UPDATE - 2021-09-12:
  - The year is 2021, I'm back to a relatively normal life despite my skin being nearly translucent from having spent the so much of the last year and a half inside. I finally decided to add some little tweaks. Now the battlescript game is functional, and kinda cute. It would be impressive if I were in elementary school.
